## [Unreleased]

### Added
- The core loop: draft, validate, repair (bounded, then pause the unit), coverage and an atomic
  commit, with complete provenance on every committed version.
- Migration `0003`: `unit_versions`, `validations`, `coverage`, `exports`.
- The unit page and `ideapress unit list|show|history`, showing content, coverage, validation and
  the attempts that produced it.
- Deterministic validation: all seven families from workflows §4 — structural, length, format,
  content constraints, reference integrity, consistency and safety — with failures classed blocking
  or advisory, and no model involved anywhere.
- Context assembly to a token budget, with the reduction order as data. Requirements and the unit
  specification are never dropped; when they alone exceed the budget the stage fails carrying both
  the required figure and the budget.
- The stage runner: a background thread per stage, the unit state machine as a transition table,
  persisted gap-free stage events, and SSE that replays from `Last-Event-ID` after a disconnect.
- `POST /projects/{id}/plan`, `POST /projects/{id}/stages/{stage}/run`, the task and stream
  endpoints, `GET /workflows`, and the plan page showing each requirement beside its quotation.
- `ideapress plan build|show` and `ideapress stage run|list|status|cancel`.
- Migration `0002`: `requirements`, `units`, `stage_runs`, `attempts`, `stage_events`.
- Requirement compilation: every requirement carries a verbatim quotation from the author material,
  and one that cannot be quoted is refused and shown as refused. Check kinds are a closed set of
  literal-string and numeric comparisons; there is deliberately no pattern check.
- The plan gate: every blocking requirement must be assigned to at least one unit, and an empty
  requirement list or an empty plan does not satisfy it.
- The inference port (`InferenceBackend`, `StageRequest`, `StageResult`, `StageEvent`,
  `BackendHealth`) and three adapters: Ollama over ModelRack, a deterministic offline fake, and an
  OpenAI-compatible one. Switching between them is configuration.
- One generation runs at a time, through one function, and the resident model is unloaded before a
  different one loads (ADR-0038).
- The prompt pack on `setspec.prompts`: versioned JSON records with a hashed manifest.
- `GET /backends`, `POST /backends/test`, a backend page that states where content goes, and
  `ideapress backend list|test|switch`.
- Projects: create, list, open, update, archive, and delete with a preview of exactly what will be
  removed. Slugs are derived from the title and never taken from input, and a project's artifact
  directory is created private and containment-checked.
- Migration `0001` on WeightsDB's runner: `projects`, `sources`, `settings`, `api_tokens`, verified
  against both SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 including the Alembic-to-models parity check.
- `ideapress project create|list|show|archive|delete` and `ideapress db upgrade|status|backup|restore`.
- Project list and detail pages, with the shared CSRF token on every form.
- Application skeleton on the shared packages: typed settings with the documented precedence and
  refusals, structured logging with the suite's correlation fields, `/health`, `/version`,
  `/system/status`, the system page, and the `serve`/`health`/`doctor`/`version`/`config` commands.
- `[execution]` configuration: `max_concurrent_stages` (only 1 is accepted; a higher value is
  refused at startup) and `unload_before_model_switch`.
- A startup check that `[models.stages]`, `StageId` and workflows §2 name the same stages, and
  refuses a binding for a stage that does not exist or a model-using stage with none.

### Fixed
- The CI workflow parses again: an edit had left a duplicate `env:` key on one step, which GitHub
  refuses and PyYAML accepts, so the whole workflow was invalid and no job ran. A test now loads it
  with a loader that refuses duplicate keys the way GitHub does.
- The PostgreSQL CI job now names the server `weightsdb.testing` looks for, passes
  `WEIGHTSDB_POSTGRES_URL` rather than `DATABASE_URL`, and uses the `+psycopg` driver this project
  installs; it previously could not connect at all.
- `pytest` now collects under the bare console script as well as `python -m pytest`
  (`pythonpath = ["."]`), which is the invocation CI runs.
- Coverage measures the importable `ideapress` package rather than the `src/ideapress` path, so a
  non-editable install reports real coverage instead of 0 %.
- The PostgreSQL CI job selects tests by path; it previously selected a marker this repository never
  declares, collecting nothing.
- `ruff` no longer formats `docs/`, which is a byte-identical mirror of the suite documentation.
- Restored the six mirrored `docs/apps/ideapress/` documents; three were missing and three had been
  edited downstream.

### Changed
- `loadcoach` moved out of the `dev` extra into a `loadcoach-contract` extra, so the default
  development and CI environment has no other application installed.

- Widened the `sweatmeter` pin to `>=0.4,<0.5`. SweatMeter's first published release is `0.4.0`
  (`0.3.0` completed its development plan but never reached the index), and it adds the in-process
  NVML GPU backend, selected automatically wherever the optional `pynvml` extra is installed.

### Added
- Repository scaffold generated from the suite's development plan (no functional code yet).
