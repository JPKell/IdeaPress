[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), pre-1.0 per
packaging and release standards §3.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `pytest` now collects under the bare console script as well as `python -m pytest`
  (`pythonpath = ["."]`), which is the invocation CI runs.
- Coverage measures the importable `ideapress` package rather than the `src/ideapress` path, so a
  non-editable install reports real coverage instead of 0 %.
- The PostgreSQL CI job selects tests by path; it previously selected a marker this repository never
  declares, collecting nothing.
- `ruff` no longer formats `docs/`, which is a byte-identical mirror of the suite documentation.
- Restored the six mirrored `docs/apps/ideapress/` documents; three were missing and three had been
  edited downstream.

### Changed
- `loadcoach` moved out of the `dev` extra into a `loadcoach-contract` extra, so the default
  development and CI environment has no other application installed.

- Widened the `sweatmeter` pin to `>=0.4,<0.5`. SweatMeter's first published release is `0.4.0`
  (`0.3.0` completed its development plan but never reached the index), and it adds the in-process
  NVML GPU backend, selected automatically wherever the optional `pynvml` extra is installed.

### Added
- Repository scaffold generated from the suite's development plan (no functional code yet).
