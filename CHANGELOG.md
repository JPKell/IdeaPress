## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Projects: create, list, open, update, archive, and delete with a preview of exactly what will be
  removed. Slugs are derived from the title and never taken from input, and a project's artifact
  directory is created private and containment-checked.
- Migration `0001` on WeightsDB's runner: `projects`, `sources`, `settings`, `api_tokens`, verified
  against both SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 including the Alembic-to-models parity check.
- `ideapress project create|list|show|archive|delete` and `ideapress db upgrade|status|backup|restore`.
- Project list and detail pages, with the shared CSRF token on every form.
- Application skeleton on the shared packages: typed settings with the documented precedence and
  refusals, structured logging with the suite's correlation fields, `/health`, `/version`,
  `/system/status`, the system page, and the `serve`/`health`/`doctor`/`version`/`config` commands.
- `[execution]` configuration: `max_concurrent_stages` (only 1 is accepted; a higher value is
  refused at startup) and `unload_before_model_switch`.
- A startup check that `[models.stages]`, `StageId` and workflows §2 name the same stages, and
  refuses a binding for a stage that does not exist or a model-using stage with none.

### Fixed
- The PostgreSQL CI job now names the server `weightsdb.testing` looks for, passes
  `WEIGHTSDB_POSTGRES_URL` rather than `DATABASE_URL`, and uses the `+psycopg` driver this project
  installs; it previously could not connect at all.
- `pytest` now collects under the bare console script as well as `python -m pytest`
  (`pythonpath = ["."]`), which is the invocation CI runs.
- Coverage measures the importable `ideapress` package rather than the `src/ideapress` path, so a
  non-editable install reports real coverage instead of 0 %.
- The PostgreSQL CI job selects tests by path; it previously selected a marker this repository never
  declares, collecting nothing.
- `ruff` no longer formats `docs/`, which is a byte-identical mirror of the suite documentation.
- Restored the six mirrored `docs/apps/ideapress/` documents; three were missing and three had been
  edited downstream.

### Changed
- `loadcoach` moved out of the `dev` extra into a `loadcoach-contract` extra, so the default
  development and CI environment has no other application installed.

- Widened the `sweatmeter` pin to `>=0.4,<0.5`. SweatMeter's first published release is `0.4.0`
  (`0.3.0` completed its development plan but never reached the index), and it adds the in-process
  NVML GPU backend, selected automatically wherever the optional `pynvml` extra is installed.

### Added
- Repository scaffold generated from the suite's development plan (no functional code yet).
